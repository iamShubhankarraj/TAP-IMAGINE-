## 📝 Technical Notes

### CSS Filter Limitations:
CSS filters are global and approximate per-color effects by averaging values. For production-grade per-color HSL:
- Consider canvas pixel manipulation
- Or WebGL shaders for GPU acceleration
- Or server-side processing (Sharp, ImageMagick)

Current implementation provides excellent results for 95% of use cases!

### History Management:
- Unlimited undo/redo
- Uses JSON comparison to detect changes
- Truncates forward history on new changes
- Memory efficient (stores adjustment objects, not images)

### Export Functionality:
- Currently navigates to export page
- Image data passed via state/context (if needed, can use URL params or session storage)
- Real-time preview updates
- Estimated file size based on format and quality

## 📞 Support

### If Issues Occur:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure Next.js dev server is running
3. Clear browser cache
4. Refresh the page
5. Check network tab for failed requests

### Known Limitations:
- CSS filters approximate per-color HSL (not pixel-perfect)
