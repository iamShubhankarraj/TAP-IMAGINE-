   - "Add the person from reference in this background area"
   - "Change this sky to match the sunset from reference"

**Result**: Pixel-precise edits with perfect style matching!

## 📊 Technical Details

### Lasso Selection
```typescript
// Selection data sent to AI
{
  imageData: "base64...",           // Original image
  maskImage: "base64...",           // White on black mask (internal use)
  boundingBox: {                    // Sent in prompt
    x: 120,
    y: 150,
    width: 200,
    height: 300
  }
}

// Enhanced prompt sent to Gemini
"In this image, modify ONLY the selected area at position 
x:120, y:150, width:200, height:300. 
[USER_PROMPT]. 
Keep all other parts of the image exactly the same."
```

### Reference Images
```typescript
// API call structure
generateImageWithGemini({
  primaryImage: "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",  // Main image
  referenceImages: [                            // Array of references
    "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
    "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
  ],
  prompt: "User's creative instruction...",
})

// All images sent to Gemini as inline data
parts: [
  { text: enhancedPrompt },
  { inlineData: { data: primaryImageBase64, mimeType: "image/jpeg" } },
  { inlineData: { data: reference1Base64, mimeType: "image/jpeg" } },
  { inlineData: { data: reference2Base64, mimeType: "image/jpeg" } },
]
```
