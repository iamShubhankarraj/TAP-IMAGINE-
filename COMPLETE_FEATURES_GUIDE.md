### Combined Power

1. **Area Selection + Reference Images**
   - Select a specific area (e.g., clothing)
   - Upload reference image (e.g., desired pattern)
   - Prompt: "Apply the pattern from reference to this shirt"
   - Result: Only the selected shirt area gets the reference pattern

2. **Multi-Reference + Area Editing**
   - Upload multiple reference images (different styles, objects)
   - Select area with lasso tool
   - Combine elements: "Add the person from reference 1 and the background from reference 2 in this selected area"

## üé® Best Practices

### For Lasso Selection:
1. **Precise Selection**: Draw tight around your target area
2. **Clear Prompts**: Be specific about changes
3. **Good**: "Make this t-shirt bright red"
4. **Bad**: "Change this"

### For Reference Images:
1. **Quality Matters**: Use high-quality, clear reference images
2. **Relevant References**: Upload images that clearly show what you want
3. **Name Elements**: Mention "reference image" or "reference 1, 2, 3" in prompts
4. **Good**: "Add this person from the reference to my left side"
5. **Bad**: "Add someone"

### For Combined Usage:
1. **Order Matters**: Upload references before using lasso tool
2. **Specific Instructions**: Clearly specify which reference for what purpose
3. **Iteration**: Don't expect perfection first try, refine prompts
4. **Test**: Try area-specific first, then full image if needed

## üîß Technical Notes

### Lasso Selection
- Creates bounding box from selected points
- Sends coordinates in prompt to Gemini
- AI interprets area from coordinates
- No actual mask sent (Gemini limitation)

### Reference Images
- Sent as additional image inputs to Gemini API
- Supports multiple references (up to API limit)
- Base64 encoded with main image
- AI analyzes all images together

### Processing Flow
```
User Action ‚Üí Selection/Reference Setup ‚Üí Prompt Enhancement ‚Üí 
Gemini API Call ‚Üí Image Generation ‚Üí Display Result ‚Üí 
Adjustments/Filters ‚Üí Export

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Lasso Tool Issues

**Problem**: Can't complete selection
**Solution**: Need at least 3 points

**Problem**: Wrong area edited
**Solution**: Be more specific in prompt, improve selection precision

**Problem**: Tool won't open
**Solution**: Upload an image first

### Reference Image Issues

**Problem**: Can't see uploaded references
**Solution**: Check preview grid in Prompt tab, should show thumbnails

**Problem**: AI not using references
**Solution**: Explicitly mention "reference image" in your prompt

**Problem**: Too many references
**Solution**: Use 1-3 for best results, more can confuse AI

### Combined Issues

**Problem**: Area edit ignoring reference
**Solution**: Ensure reference uploaded BEFORE lasso selection, mention it in area prompt

## üöÄ Pro Tips

1. **Chain Edits**: Use generated image as base for next edit (automatic chaining)
2. **Undo/Redo**: Use header buttons if you don't like a result
3. **Save Iterations**: Export each version before trying next edit
4. **Experiment**: Try different prompts for same selection
5. **Reference Library**: Keep folder of useful reference images
6. **Combine Tools**: Use filters and adjustments AFTER AI editing
7. **Templates**: Check Templates tab for pre-made prompts
