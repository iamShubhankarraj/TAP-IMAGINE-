   - Type: "make it vintage style"
   - Click "Generate"
   - Wait for AI to process
   
3. **Second Generation (Chaining!)**
   - The generated vintage image is now your base
   - Type new prompt: "add dramatic sunset colors"
   - Click "Generate"
   - AI will use the vintage image + new prompt
   
4. **Keep Chaining!**
   - Type: "make it look cinematic"
   - Click "Generate"
   - Each generation builds on the previous!
   
5. **Compare with Original**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 Tip 1: Build Complex Edits Gradually
Instead of one complex prompt:
```
❌ "make it vintage with sunset and cinematic look and dramatic shadows"
```

Do multiple generations:
```
✅ Step 1: "make it vintage"
✅ Step 2: "add sunset colors"  
✅ Step 3: "make it cinematic"
✅ Step 4: Use Adjustments tab for shadows
```

### 🎯 Tip 2: Use Adjustments After AI
- Generate with AI for major changes
- Use Adjustments tab for fine-tuning
- Combine both for best results!

### 🎯 Tip 3: Experiment Freely
- Use Undo/Redo to try different adjustments
- Go back and forth between Export and Editor
- Your work is always saved!

### 🎯 Tip 4: Compare Often
- Hold the "Hold to Compare" button frequently
- Make sure you're improving the original
- Helps you know when to stop editing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Export page is blank
**Solution:** Make sure you have an image in the editor first

### Issue: Going back clears my work
**Solution:** This should be fixed! If it happens:
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you're using the latest code
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: AI not chaining properly
**Solution:** 
- Wait for first generation to complete
- Make sure green checkmark appears
- Then write second prompt

### Issue: Adjustments not appearing in export
**Solution:**
- This should be fixed!
- Export now applies all CSS filters
- If not working, check browser console

## 📊 Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React Context API
- EditorContext wraps entire app
- State persists across page navigation
- No need for localStorage or session storage

### Image Chaining Logic
```typescript
// Always uses latest edited image
const imageToProcess = generatedImage?.url || primaryImage?.url;

// Send to Gemini
generateImageWithGemini({
  primaryImage: imageToProcess, // Latest!
  prompt: newPrompt
});
```

### Export Processing
```typescript
// Gets current image with all adjustments
const displayImage = generatedImage || primaryImage;
const cssFilter = generateCSSFilter(adjustments, currentFilter);

// Applies to canvas
ctx.filter = cssFilter;
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);

// Exports with effects baked in
canvas.toBlob(blob => download(blob));
```
